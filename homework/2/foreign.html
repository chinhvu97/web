      <p>
        Murakami writes and runs everyday without fail. But he always stops at
        the point where he could write more, at the point before his legs are
        exhausted.

        To keep on going, you have to keep up the rhythm. This is the important
        thing for long-term projects. Once you set the pace, the rest will
        follow. The problem is getting the flywheel to spin at a set speed—and
        to get to that point takes as much concentration and effort as you can
        manage.

        In What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, Haruki Murakami doesn't
        try to convince others that we should all become long distance
        runners/triathletes like him. He does talk about why he took up running,
        how it has helped him with his creativity and why he will continue to
        run as long as he feels the need to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've never read a book by Murakami, other than this one. But, the
        interesting way in which he views the world makes me think that I'd
        probably enjoy his stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        He wasn't just looking for a way to become fit. He wanted a exercise
        where he was left alone with his thoughts and challenged to focus for
        long periods of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Murakami says that, when he writes a novel, it is a matter of focus and
        endurance. He finds it difficult to "drill down through the rock of the
        mind to hit veins of creativity." (Quoting from memory, please forgive
        the inaccuracies.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The focus that runners use to finish a long race is similar, he
        believes, to the focus needed to write page after page until the end of
        a novel. I think that type of mental ability is something that could be
        used in any creative endeavor, not just writing. For Murakami, writing
        is how he makes his art.
      </p>
      <p>
        I liked that, even though Murakami loves running and extols its virtues,
        he says that he never tells other people that they should take it up. He
        thinks that our life paths reveal themselves to us in a unique way that
        only we know.
      </p>
      <p class="text-italic">
        He runs because he loves it. If you love it too, run. If you don't, do
        what you love- walk, skip, jump, swim, whatever.

        Incumbent President Zach Herney is fighting for his life in an upcoming
        election against the slick and slippery Senator Sedwick Sexton. Herney
        is a staunch supporter of NASA, while Sexton has been using the
        expensive, mistake-prone, and nonprofitable agency as a convenient
        whipping-boy in his stump speeches. Protagonist Rachel Sexton, the
        senator’s daughter, works for the National Reconnaissance Office, where
        she digests information into reports used by the White House. The fact
        that she works so closely with the president has made for no small
        amount of tension between her and her father, of course. At the outset
        of the story, Rachel is whisked off to a spot somewhere near the Arctic
        Circle where NASA is trying to recover a meteor with what looks like
        fossils of extraterrestrial life on it from underneath two hundred feet
        of ice. Naturally, things aren’t quite what they seem, what with the
        small band of Delta Force soldiers secretly watching the NASA
        encampment. The more that Rachel learns about the meteor, with the help
        of popular scientist Michael Tolland and a NASA techie by the name of
        Corky, the less things make sense. The author has an impressive grasp of
        his material, and even though this is the type of thriller where the
        gadgetry is often more believable than the wooden characters (the Delta
        Force soldiers’ guns that create bullets out of snow are especially
        cool), Brown’s scientific knowledge isn’t what ultimately dooms the
        book. The story, which has an initial rush to it, bogs down once it
        starts plodding through all the government shenanigans and secret plots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Brown is a more astute storyteller than most of his brethren in
        the technothriller vein, and won’t lose any fans this time out, he’s
        never able to convincingly marry the technical and the human sides of
        Deception Point.

        Are you ready for a faster-paced, creepier Gone Girl?

      <p>
        Woah. This is one unsettling little thriller and the best bit about it
        is that <span class="text-bold">no one can be trusted</span>, including
        the three female narrators who share the storytelling of this book. I
        literally read this entire novel in one sitting and I now need to find
        the words to convince you to go get your hands on it. RIGHT NOW.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between an alcoholic, a liar and a cheat,
        <span class="text-bold">who can you trust?</span> These are the three
        women at the centre of this book: Rachel, Anna and Megan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have you ever sat on the train, glanced at the people around you or out
        of the window, and made up stories about them? Maybe you've even gone so
        far as to invent names for these people and imagine their perfect or
        not-so-perfect lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rachel is that girl on the train who takes her mind off her own life by
        imagining the lives of others. Specifically the lives of "Jess and
        Jason" who live at the house outside her train window when the train
        stops at the same red signal every morning. But then one morning, things
        are not as they are supposed to be and Rachel sees something that
        completely shatters the "Jess and Jason" image which exists in her head.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now she is pulled into their lives. Unsure exactly what she knows but
        certain she cannot rest until she finds out.
      </p>
      <p>
        This book is just full of secrets. Everyone has them. It's about all the
        little mysteries that exist just outside of what we see on the surface.
        What goes on behind closed doors? How much can you ever really know a
        person? What horrors exist in that black spot of your memory from
        Saturday night?
      </p>
      <p>It was fascinating, gripping and oh so very creepy.</p>
