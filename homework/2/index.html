            The book shows us how Politics relate, affect to most of ourlives.
            Each character, in order to survive, has to do what they consider as

            Rachel catches the same commuter train every morning. She knows it
            will wait at the same signal each time, overlooking a row of back
            gardens. She’s even started to feel like she knows the people who
            live in one of the houses. “Jess and Jason,” she calls them. Their
            life—as she sees it—is perfect. If only Rachel could be that happy.
            And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the
            train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Now
            Rachel has a chance to become a part of the lives she’s only watched
            from afar. Now they’ll see; she’s much more than just the girl on
            the train...

          <p>
            Murakami takes us through his training regimen and we follow him as
            he runs mile after mile after mile. While we are reading, we become
            aware what it means to run a marathon, what is involved, what is
            required, what passes through the mind of the runner, and so forth.
